The guiding principle behind our work is that there must be a good reason for brokerage firms to spend billions of dollars a year on stock research. Obviously, these investment experts know something special that may be indicative of the future direction of stock prices. From day one, we were determined to unlock that secret knowledge and make it available to our clients to help them improve their investment results.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EIn 1978 our founder, Len Zacks, made a breakthrough. Armed with his PhD in Mathematics from MIT, Len discovered that:\\\\\\\\nEarnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EFrom there he developed a quantitative model to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions - the direction, the degree of change, and surprises - along with other important variables to create the Zacks Rank.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EThis unique and innovative rating system predicted the potential for future stock price increases. In fact, it proved itself as a system that clearly stated when to buy, sell, and hold stocks. And it was very unusual in that it provided an equal number of buys and sells. Unheard of in the days when all Wall Street could say was \\\\\\\\u0026#8220;Buy\\\\\\\\u0026#8221;.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EZacks Rank is completely mathematical. It\\\\\\\\u0026#8221;s cold. It\\\\\\\\u0026#8221;s objective. The Zacks Rank does not care what the hype on the street says. Or how many times the CEO appeared on TV. Or how this company could some day, maybe, if everything works perfectly, and the stars are aligned become the next Microsoft. The Zack Rank only cares about the math and whether the math predicts that the price will rise.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003ENeedless to say, leading firms in the investment industry wanted to use this rating tool as part of their decision making process.

Adipose tissue (fat) is composed primarily of cells that store unused calories for later use. The balance between how the body stores excess calories and later accesses these depots when required plays a critical role in determining the overall size of the fat tissue, and therefore, an individual\\\\\\\\u0026#8217;s weight. Zafgen\\\\\\\\u00e2\\\\\\\\u20ac\\\\\\\\u2122s groundbreaking approach targets obesity at its biological foundation by safely restoring the balance of fat metabolism, driving the loss of fat and a return to a more healthy body weight.

Login with Sina Weibo (China\\\\\\\\u0026#8217;s Twitter) and Zaizher immediately pulls in your Weibo profile information, including profile photo, tags, introduction, fans, tweets and verification information, filling out your personal business card. When users find someone of interest they can swap business cards and then chat online. \\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003ETo help users quickly find people of interest Zaizher offers a Filter/Search function and Events section. Through the Filter function users can filter by distance and industry, and will be able to filter by city, tags, titles, companies and other information in the future. In the future Zaizher will analyze user data to provide customized recommendations, allowing users to quickly connect with people they are most interested in.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EEvents provides users with a list of upcoming business events going on around the country. Users can view recommended events and register to attend directly through Zaizher. Once inside users can see who else will be/is/has attending/ed. These are saved permanently so that whenever users want to find someone they can go back and open the event and search for them.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EZaizher has also developed a event promotion platform similar to EventBrite but focused on providing event organizers a mobile promotion and interaction platform. This allows event organizers to push invitations directly to their invitees phones through push notification and text message. Attendees can then RSVP/register through text, mobile web, or Zaizher. \\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EThis event platform enables Zaizher to bring 100% of attendees into the app, regardless of whether or not they are Zaizher users. Non-Zaizher users are notified by text message when they receive business cards through Zaizher.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EZaizher is aiming to become the LinkedIn of China. LinkedIn and LinkedIn like clones have not taken off in China for a two major of reasons:\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003E1 - Chinese do not like sharing their contacts. In a country where guanxi is king, the thought of opening up phonebooks for others to see is against Chinese cultural norms. Common contacts is the basis for trust on LinkedIn without this data it is very difficult for LinkedIn to operate.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003E2 - Chinese value face-to-face communication over online communication. The average Chinese business person is always on the road, from one meeting to the next, there has very little time to spend in front of a PC.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EZaizher\\\\\\\\u0026#8217;s model is uniquely Chinese in two ways:\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003E1- Mobile/location based service allows users to quickly setup face-to-face meetings. When users see other interesting users close by they can immediately setup a time to meet for coffee or lunch.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003E2- Zaizher relies on open information in existing networks to generate trust between users, similar to how BranchOut users Facebook. \\\\\\\\u0026#8216;Friends\\\\\\\\u0026#8217; collected on Zaizher are completely private. \\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003E3- Zaizher\\\\\\\\u0026#8217;s app provides a drastically simplified professional networking experience, that is accessible to the generation of working class that did not grow up with computers (Chinese aged 30+). Zaizher focuses on the most basic aspect, connecting users with other people of interest.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EZaizher is currently the leading mobile professional network in China.

In the course of his adventure, he was pursued by a big question mark (?) symbol. He was caught up in the chase, and as the symbol stuck to him there was a big explosion. He then saw pieces of letters floating in the horizon. It took a while before he figured out that the set of letters spell his name, and the word \\\\\\\\u0026#8220;Zeenoh\\\\\\\\u0026#8221; was highlighted. People sometimes pronounce \\\\\\\\u0026#8220;Zeenoh\\\\\\\\u0026#8221; as \\\\\\\\u0026#8220;Sino\\\\\\\\u0026#8221;, which means \\\\\\\\u0026#8220;Who?\\\\\\\\u0026#8221; in English.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EAs you become more curious about the games we develop, the more you become interested to Zeenoh Games.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EJoin Us!\\\\\\\\nZeenoh Games would like to be known in the gaming industry.

Most computer users store most of their content in files and folders on their primary PCs, but they are also storing content in other devices and on the Internet. As a result, their digital content has become scattered and it can feel overwhelming to find, manage and share all of their files, documents, emails, photos, videos, music and social content.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EZeroDesktop\\\\\\\\u00e2\\\\\\\\u20ac\\\\\\\\u2122s flagship product, ZeroPC, bridges the gap between the Internet and computers.

ZeroPC connects the user\\\\\\\\u00e2\\\\\\\\u20ac\\\\\\\\u2122s cross-platform content regardless of where it is stored, making content accessible using a browser on any device (desktop, laptop, netbook, tablet, smartphone) where they can easily search, analyze, navigate, backup and share cloud content from a single site with a single login.

These people often do not have the luxury of owning computers and depend on shared computing resources such as Internet cafes, libraries, community centers or a local YMCA. In many cases, these people must carry USB storage devices containing their content in order to work, study or access the Internet.

The values of virtualization including flexibility, scalability and mobility complicate business continuity efforts in times of disaster. To realize the benefits of virtualization, organizations need to optimize IT processes for virtual environments. Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery is difficult - because to date there have been no virtual-ready replication methods that scale for large data centers. Traditional physical replication tools are complex \\\\\\\\u0026amp; manual, while virtual replication tools are not built for scale and reliability. With hypervisor-based replication, all that changes. Zerto is storage agnostic, simple to install, intuitive to use, \\\\\\\\u0026amp; is suited for both data centers and cloud.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EFounded by a team of storage industry veterans, Zerto provides large enterprises with business continuity and disaster recovery solutions designed specifically for virtualized infrastructure and the cloud. Zerto Virtual Replication is the industry\\\\\\\\u2019s first hypervisor-based replication solution for tier-one applications, replacing traditional array-based BC/DR solutions that were not built to deal with the virtual paradigm.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EZiv Kedem, Zerto\\\\\\\\u2019s co-founder and CEO, previously co-founded Kashya, acquired by EMC.

Though there are other microlending websites that allow individuals to contribute funds toward microloans of their choice, all of them rely on local microfinance organizations to communicate with lenders, create loan applications and collect repayments. In these intermediated microlending platforms, the communication is all one way, so that the borrower is often unaware of the lenders who funded his or her loan. The average intermediary organization adds over 30% - sometimes as much as 100% - in fees and interest to loans raised through these websites to cover its own administrative expenses. Such high interest rates reduce borrowers\\\\\\\\u0026#8217; profits, sometimes to the point of making them poorer than they were before they received the loan.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u003Cp\\\\\\\\u003EUnlike the postings on other microlending platforms, the loan applications and comments posted on Zidisha\\\\\\\\u0026#8217;s loan pages are written by the borrowers themselves. This opens the way for dialogue between lenders and borrowers, so that lenders can receive answers to their inquiries about the loan and business directly from the entrepreneur they are funding. Eliminating unnecessary intermediaries also decreases cost of the loans. The average Zidisha borrower pays only about 8% (flat rate) in annual interest and fees, including interest paid out to lenders. This is far below the rates traditionally charged for microfinance loans in developing countries.  Reducing interest costs allows the entrepreneurs to keep more of their profits, so that the loans have greater impact in reducing poverty.\\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\",\\\\n \"image\":\\\\n  {\"available_sizes\":\\\\n    [[[150,\\\\n       37],\\\\n      \"assets/images/resized/0020/2182/202182v2-max-150x150.png\"],\\\\n     [[250,\\\\n       63],\\\\n      \"assets/images/resized/0020/2182/202182v2-max-250x250.png\"],\\\\n     [[250,\\\\n       63],\\\\n      \"assets/images/resized/0020/2182/202182v2-max-450x450.png\"]],\\\\n   \"attribution\": null},\\\\n \"products\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"relationships\":\\\\n  [{\"is_past\": false,\\\\n    \"title\": \"Director\",\\\\n    \"person\":\\\\n     {\"first_name\": \"Julia\",\\\\n      \"last_name\": \"Kurnia\",\\\\n      \"permalink\": \"julia-kurnia\",\\\\n      \"image\": null}}],\\\\n \"competitions\":\\\\n  [{\"competitor\":\\\\n     {\"name\": \"Kiva\",\\\\n      \"permalink\": \"kiva\",\\\\n      \"image\":\\\\n       {\"available_sizes\":\\\\n         [[[150,\\\\n            89],\\\\n           \"assets/images/resized/0000/4525/4525v1-max-150x150.png\"],\\\\n          [[170,\\\\n            101],\\\\n           \"assets/images/resized/0000/4525/4525v1-max-250x250.png\"],\\\\n          [[170,\\\\n            101],\\\\n           \"assets/images/resized/0000/4525/4525v1-max-450x450.png\"]],\\\\n        \"attribution\": null}}},\\\\n   {\"competitor\":\\\\n     {\"name\": \"MyC4\",\\\\n      \"permalink\": \"myc4\",\\\\n      \"image\": null}},\\\\n   {\"competitor\":\\\\n     {\"name\": \"MicroPlace\",\\\\n      \"permalink\": \"microplace\",\\\\n      \"image\":\\\\n       {\"available_sizes\":\\\\n         [[[150,\\\\n            45],\\\\n           \"assets/images/resized/0002/7063/27063v3-max-150x150.png\"],\\\\n          [[250,\\\\n            75],\\\\n           \"assets/images/resized/0002/7063/27063v3-max-250x250.png\"],\\\\n          [[450,\\\\n            135],\\\\n           \"assets/images/resized/0002/7063/27063v3-max-450x450.png\"]],\\\\n        \"attribution\": null}}},\\\\n   {\"competitor\":\\\\n     {\"name\": \"Wokai.org\",\\\\n      \"permalink\": \"wokai-org\",\\\\n      \"image\": null}}],\\\\n \"providerships\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"total_money_raised\": \"$0\",\\\\n \"funding_rounds\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"investments\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"acquisition\": null,\\\\n \"acquisitions\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"offices\":\\\\n  [{\"description\": \"\",\\\\n    \"address1\": \"21900 Muirfield Circle\",\\\\n    \"address2\": \"#302\",\\\\n    \"zip_code\": \"20164\",\\\\n    \"city\": \"Sterling\",\\\\n    \"state_code\": \"VA\",\\\\n    \"country_code\": \"USA\",\\\\n    \"latitude\": null,\\\\n    \"longitude\": null}],\\\\n \"milestones\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"ipo\": null,\\\\n \"video_embeds\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"screenshots\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"external_links\":\\\\n  [{\"external_url\": \"http://mashable.com/2012/04/24/zidisha/\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"Zidisha: The Online Micro-Loan Platform that Kiva Wants to Be Like\"},\\\\n   {\"external_url\": \"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223391\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"Is Microfinance for You?\"},\\\\n   {\"external_url\": \"http://www.quora.com/Kiva/What-are-some-good-alternatives-to-Kiva\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"What are some good alternatives to Kiva?\"},\\\\n   {\"external_url\": \"http://findwhatworks.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/so-that-thing-kiva-just-started-doing-zidisha-was-already-doing-it/\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"So that thing Kiva just started doing?

point.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nZipcar pioneered the car sharing service sector - this is a a rental alternative whereby drivers pay for memberships that allow them to rent cars by the hour. Its useful for people who want to get a car to getaway for the weekend or to go grocery shopping. It has taken off in urban areas and college towns, where people don\\\\\\'t own cars because it is too expensive or too much of a hassle to park.\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\r\\\\\\\\nIn the first quarter, Zipcar\\\\\\'s loss widened to $5.3M from $3M a year earlier, through revenue jumped 29% to $33.2M.

ZippGo boxes are delivered and picked up using trucks powered by biodiesel made from waste vegetable oil.  \\\\\\\\u003C/p\\\\\\\\u003E\",\\\\n \"image\":\\\\n  {\"available_sizes\":\\\\n    [[[130,\\\\n       150],\\\\n      \"assets/images/resized/0010/4361/104361v2-max-150x150.jpg\"],\\\\n     [[218,\\\\n       250],\\\\n      \"assets/images/resized/0010/4361/104361v2-max-250x250.jpg\"],\\\\n     [[349,\\\\n       400],\\\\n      \"assets/images/resized/0010/4361/104361v2-max-450x450.jpg\"]],\\\\n   \"attribution\": null},\\\\n \"products\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"relationships\":\\\\n  [{\"is_past\": true,\\\\n    \"title\": \"CEO and Founder\",\\\\n    \"person\":\\\\n     {\"first_name\": \"Ash\",\\\\n      \"last_name\": \"Sud\",\\\\n      \"permalink\": \"ash-sud\",\\\\n      \"image\": null}}],\\\\n \"competitions\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"providerships\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"total_money_raised\": \"$0\",\\\\n \"funding_rounds\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"investments\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"acquisition\": null,\\\\n \"acquisitions\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"offices\":\\\\n  [{\"description\": \"Headquarters\",\\\\n    \"address1\": \"548 Market St. #38930\",\\\\n    \"address2\": \"\",\\\\n    \"zip_code\": \"94107\",\\\\n    \"city\": \"San Francisco\",\\\\n    \"state_code\": \"CA\",\\\\n    \"country_code\": \"USA\",\\\\n    \"latitude\": null,\\\\n    \"longitude\": null},\\\\n   {\"description\": \"Sales Office\",\\\\n    \"address1\": \"\",\\\\n    \"address2\": \"\",\\\\n    \"zip_code\": \"94107\",\\\\n    \"city\": \"San Francisco\",\\\\n    \"state_code\": \"CA\",\\\\n    \"country_code\": \"USA\",\\\\n    \"latitude\": null,\\\\n    \"longitude\": null}],\\\\n \"milestones\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"ipo\": null,\\\\n \"video_embeds\":\\\\n  [],\\\\n \"screenshots\":\\\\n  [{\"available_sizes\":\\\\n     [[[150,\\\\n        133],\\\\n       \"assets/images/resized/0007/5033/75033v2-max-150x150.png\"],\\\\n      [[250,\\\\n        223],\\\\n       \"assets/images/resized/0007/5033/75033v2-max-250x250.png\"],\\\\n      [[450,\\\\n        401],\\\\n       \"assets/images/resized/0007/5033/75033v2-max-450x450.png\"]],\\\\n    \"attribution\": null},\\\\n   {\"available_sizes\":\\\\n     [[[150,\\\\n        141],\\\\n       \"assets/images/resized/0007/5034/75034v2-max-150x150.png\"],\\\\n      [[250,\\\\n        236],\\\\n       \"assets/images/resized/0007/5034/75034v2-max-250x250.png\"],\\\\n      [[450,\\\\n        425],\\\\n       \"assets/images/resized/0007/5034/75034v2-max-450x450.png\"]],\\\\n    \"attribution\": null}],\\\\n \"external_links\":\\\\n  [{\"external_url\": \"http://www.triplepundit.com/2009/10/green-your-next-move-with-zippgo/\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"Triple Pundit\"},\\\\n   {\"external_url\": \"http://news.yahoo.com/s/prweb/20100121/bs_prweb/prweb3480774_1\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"Yahoo News\"},\\\\n   {\"external_url\": \"http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/sf/a-solution-to-those-pesky-moving-boxes-zippgo-099448\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"Apartment Therapy\"},\\\\n   {\"external_url\": \"http://mashable.com/2010/09/29/zippgo/\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"Mashable\"},\\\\n   {\"external_url\": \"http://mashable.com/2010/09/29/zippgo/\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"Mashable\"},\\\\n   {\"external_url\": \"http://www.mnn.com/eco-biz/sustainable-business-practices/blogs/innovation-rules-at-sb2010\",\\\\n    \"title\": \"MNN.com\"}]}\\'\\n', 'p0\\n', '.']\n",
